												<h2>Regulatory and Departmental Audits</h2>
												<p>Identify your process weakness</p>
											</header>



											<p>Regulatory restrictions are often times complex and detailed. Arcane’s analysts are closely
											 familiar with industry requirements, while monitoring planned regulatory changes. Furthermore, 
											 we are able to identify anything that may be considered non-compliant; even it appears nebulous 
											 or subtle.</p>

											 <p>At the request of our clients, Arcane will evaluate activities and process compliance with 
											 regulatory standards. By auditing lines of business and personnel we can determine whether the 
											 standards set by our client’s are being met and adhered to. </p>

											<h3>Legislative Review</h3>
											<p>Changes in the regulatory arena have resulted in government agencies taking a more collaborative 
											approach. It’s vital that businesses keep up to speed with developments and receive additional guidance, 
											ongoing supervision and compliance procedural issues. The risk of compliance failure is greater than ever before.</p>
											
											<p>Our Regulatory Analysts monitor pending and effective legislature to ensure clients adhere to laws that govern 
											their process. We take a proactive approach towards maintaining regulatory compliance through interpreting existing 
											and recently implemented laws, monitoring upcoming changes, and provide detailed summaries for clients executive 
											and department management to ensure all aspects of business operations are adhered to.</p>
